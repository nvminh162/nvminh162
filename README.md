# Hi, I'm nvminh162 👋

Delusional developer-founder.  
I build fullstack apps using Java Spring Boot, Node.js, NestJS, React, and Next.js.  
I enjoy crafting fast, scalable systems with clean code and a bit of chaos.  
Lover of cloud tech, backend logic, and the occasional frontend polish.  
Exploring new stacks, optimizing old ones.  
Shipping projects faster than my coffee gets cold.  

Currently chasing bugs, dreams, and dopamine hits from passing test cases.  
Sometimes I tweet, sometimes I deploy at 2am.  

Let's build cool things together ✨
