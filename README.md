## Hi, I'm nvminh162 ðŸ‘‹

Delusional developer-founder.  
I build fullstack apps using Java Spring Boot, Node.js, NestJS, React, and Next.js.  
I enjoy crafting fast, scalable systems with clean code and a bit of chaos.  
Lover of cloud tech, backend logic, and the occasional frontend polish.  
Exploring new stacks, optimizing old ones.  
Shipping projects faster than my coffee gets cold.  

Currently chasing bugs, dreams, and dopamine hits from passing test cases.  
Sometimes I tweet, sometimes I deploy at 2am.  

## Fun fact:

If Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably daydreaming about new projects or figuring out why the last one didn't go as planned. The path to perfection is paved with failed deploys and successful recovery.
Also, I believe every great project starts with a bit of chaosâ€”and a lot of caffeine. â˜• Letâ€™s embrace the madness and create something amazing!

ðŸš€ Always open to collaborating on exciting projects and contributing to open-source!
